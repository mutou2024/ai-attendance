Notes:
- This is a minimal scaffold intended for quick iteration and demoing the calendar & range endpoints.
- Security (auth), i18n, timezone-correct grouping, and unit tests are NOT implemented yet — to be added next.
- After you inspect/run locally I can add authentication (JWT), proper JPA entities, and more robust grouping logic.
